Handwriting Recognition
============

Slides and assets for the handwriting recognition workshop [first presented at Toronto Ruby Hack Night, April 24, 2017]

### Introduction

Recognizing handwriting with a computer seems almost impossible. This workshop looks into the foundations of neural networks capable of doing just this.

### Setup

Here are the steps to get you started with the repo.

1. For this workshop, you will need a laptop with the following:
  - [x] Ruby 2.x  
  - [x] A github account  
  Note: We have included a ``.ruby-version`` file locked to 2.1.0, which you can change to any Ruby 2.x version if you don't have 2.1.0 installed  
  More detailed instructions for each platform are included in the footer. Refer there if you are having issues.

1. Fork or clone git@github.com:k00ka/handwriting-recognition.git 
  ```sh
  % git clone git@github.com:k00ka/handwriting-recognition.git
  ```
1. Run the app:
  ```sh
  % ruby mnist.rb
  ```

### Thanks

Thanks to Luis Serrano and Geoff Buesing for the components of our exploration.
